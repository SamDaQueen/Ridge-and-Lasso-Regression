# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression
 
<h4>Created as part of course CS5100-Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University</h4>

<div>

<p>Using Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression trained on the Movie Lens database to create models and then test them. <p>

<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>

Based on the given data, we need to find
* Which predictors are significant in predicting the rating of a movie
* How well those predictors describe the rating of a movie
* Compare Ridge and Lasso regression algorithms in terms of mean squared error and number of predictors eliminated in each.

<h3>Files included</h3>

<ol>
<li>Movie-Lens-Ridge-Lasso.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with implementation of Ridge regression and Lasso regression</li>
 <li>ml-100k folder - contains 100k entries of the Movie lens database</li>
</ol>
